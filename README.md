# Autoencoder for Dimensionality reduction
 
# Description
Simple example of the Autoencoder usage in an artificial 3D dataset for dimensionality reduction.

# Goal
Train an autoencoder to shrink the information into 2 neurons and use the trained encoder part to perform dimensionality reduction into 2 dimensions with the data as seperable as possible.
